# Thermostat

### Introduction

Completed in week 5 of Makers. First JavaScript project. Wrote business logic to model a simple thermostat, and hooked it up to a dynamic visual interface using jQuery - all within the browser. Used JavaScript to fetch data from external sources and display that on the page. All tested using Jasmine. 

### Installation
